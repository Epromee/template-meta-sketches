# What it is

Some hacks and ideas for C++ metaprogramming

## closure-selector.cpp

I "pack" three types into one particular type, and then apply a "selector type" to retrieve the needed type.

## compile-time-fibonacci.cpp

Prints a fibonacci number sequence, then the compilation fails.

## list-and-conditions.cpp

Conditionally retrieves types.

## dynamic-list-and-filter.cpp

Makes a list of dynamically typed entries, and then filters only those which contain integer values. Run at Ideone: https://ideone.com/x9Ncxn

## compile-time-prime-numbers.cpp

Makes a list of prime numbers. It uses a naive algorithm, not sieves. Run at Ideone: https://ideone.com/r0bDl4
