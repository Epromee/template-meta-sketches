# What it is

Some hacks and ideas for C++ metaprogramming

## closure-selector.cpp

I "pack" three types into one particular type, and then apply "selector type" to retrieve needed type.

## compile-time-fibonacci.cpp

Prints a fibonacci number sequence, then the compilation fails.

## list-and-conditions.cpp

Conditionally retrieves types.
